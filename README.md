This Javascript code is all about an Application that shows weather from API  using  current location of users. 

Hi Folks!
Sup?
Are you looking for a method to integrate weather API? We are going to build a weather APP using vanilla javascript.

In this tutorial, a JavaScript Beginner can create a functional Weather App with ease. and won't face any problems doing that.

We have fetched some data from API and display that in our UI:
1-an Icon that shows the weather status
2-the temperature value (20Â°C) in Celsius unit.(will Convert it manually into Fahrenheit).
3-the weather description (clear sky)
4-and then the user's city and country (Ajman, UAE).

When the user clicks on the temperature value, that will convert it from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

The icons we're going to use for our web application are created by the Graphic Designer Ashley Jager. Link to her Repo: https://github.com/manifestinteractive/weather-underground-icons

The API key provider: http://www.OpenWeatherMap.org
Make sure to sign up for an account to get your own API as The API I used is just for educational Purpose.
